# crypt-x

We were tasked to develop a comprehensive web application to showcase cryptocurrency market trends 
with a focus on Bitcoinâ€™s performance over the last six months. 
The application had to have a visually appealing and user-friendly dashboard interface that had 
to match a Figma file project and it had to allow for users to engage with cryptocurrency data.
